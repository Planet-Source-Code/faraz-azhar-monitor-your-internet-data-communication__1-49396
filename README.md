### Description

Here it is... a program through which you can monitor how other program communicate through the internet. It creates a log of all the requests to servers and their replys. Of course this works only behind a proxy. Other programs connect to this program and this program further connects to a proxy server. And so in between, you can monitor what data is transmitted and received.

It has many good uses: for eg. you may want to know how to send HTTP requests to a server, in that case you can use this program to monitor IE.
